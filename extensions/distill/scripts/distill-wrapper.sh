# distill-wrapper — orchestrates a single auto-distill attempt inside a
# per-distill git worktree.
#
# PR #12 architecture: the distill AGENT owns distill content production
# AND the integration phases (merge, squash, push, cleanup). The wrapper
# is a thin shell:
#   1. Worktree setup is already done by createDistillWorkspace before
#      this script runs (git worktree add, session fork, meta.json).
#   2. Wrapper installs the napkin shim (POST-R6-CACHE), cds to PARENT_CWD
#      for cache parity, then invokes `pi --session ... -p $PROMPT` ONCE
#      under a hard `timeout(1)` budget.
#   3. Agent executes the full agent-driven prompt (extensions/distill/
#      distill-prompt.md): distill content + git merge + git merge --squash
#      + git push + git worktree remove + git branch -D.
#   4. Post-agent-exit, wrapper validates the agent's output (markers
#      absent, HEAD on default, commit count) and salvages on failure.
#   5. Wrapper writes the outcome sidecar and exits.
#
# A2 transitional state: validation + salvage are stubs in this commit
# (see TODO(A3) and TODO(A4) markers below). A3 wires post-validation;
# A4 wires the salvage path. At A2 the wrapper writes `merged-content`
# on agent-exit-0 unconditionally; that placeholder becomes a proper
# class-detection in A3.
#
# A3 update: post-agent-exit validation is wired (markers, HEAD on
# default, commit count, merged-local detection). On validation failure
# the wrapper writes `failed:<reason>` and exits 1 — the cleanup trap
# still removes the worktree+branch best-effort. A4 will replace this
# with an explicit salvage helper that force-cleans the worktree+branch
# pre-exit and emits a recovery hint into the outcome sidecar.

# Usage:
#   distill-wrapper.sh <vault> <worktree> <branch> <sessionFork> <prompt> <errorDir> [<model>] [<defaultBranch>] [<parentCwd>] [<maxDurationSecs>]
#
# Arguments:
#   <vault>          absolute path to the main vault (NOT the worktree)
#   <worktree>       absolute path to the distill worktree (lives under
#                    `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/napkin-distill/<vault-hash>/<suffix>/`;
#                    see `resolveCacheRoot` in extensions/distill/distill-workspace.ts)
#   <branch>         distill branch name (`distill/<hex>-<epoch>`)
#   <sessionFork>    absolute path to the forked session .jsonl inside the worktree
#   <prompt>         resolved agent-driven distill prompt (steps 1–10 with
#                    placeholders already substituted by `buildDistillPrompt`)
#   <errorDir>       absolute path to `<vault.configPath>/distill/errors/`
#   <model>          optional "<provider>/<id>" to pass to `pi --model`
#   <defaultBranch>  optional name of the vault's mainline branch (e.g. `main`,
#                    `master`). When empty/absent, defaults to `main`. The JS
#                    side resolves this via `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
#                    or a HEAD-ref lookup so the wrapper doesn't hardcode `main`.
#   <parentCwd>      REQUIRED. Absolute path of the parent pi session's cwd.
#                    Pi is spawned at this cwd so the system prompt's
#                    `Current working directory:` line is byte-identical
#                    to the parent's, preserving prompt-cache hits. Vault
#                    writes are still routed to the worktree via the
#                    napkin shim installed at
#                    `<worktree>/.napkin/distill/bin/napkin`. The wrapper
#                    hard-fails if this is empty (R7-PERF-7, R7-CI-6) —
#                    silently falling back to <worktree> would re-
#                    introduce the cache regression POST-R6-CACHE fixed.
#   <maxDurationSecs> hard wall-clock budget for the agent task, in
#                    seconds. Wired into `timeout(1)` so the agent is
#                    SIGTERMed (then SIGKILLed after grace) on overrun.
#                    Required at A2 onward; defaults to 600 (10 minutes)
#                    when absent for backward-compatibility with any
#                    out-of-tree caller still on the 9-arg shape.
#                    Derived from `distill.maxDurationMinutes` config.
#
# Lifecycle (happy path, PR #12):
#   1. install napkin shim at <worktree>/.napkin/distill/bin/napkin and
#      prepend it to PATH (auto-routes agent napkin calls to the worktree)
#   2. cd <parentCwd>                            (cache parity — keeps pi's
#                                                 system prompt cwd line
#                                                 byte-identical to parent's)
#   3. timeout <maxDurationSecs> pi --session <sessionFork> -p <prompt>
#                                                (single agent task: produces
#                                                 content, runs git merge into
#                                                 distill branch, squashes to
#                                                 main, pushes if origin, cleans
#                                                 up worktree+branch — see
#                                                 extensions/distill/distill-prompt.md)
#   4. validate agent output                     (A3: markers, HEAD on default,
#                                                 commit count; A4 salvage on
#                                                 fail — stubbed in this A3 commit)
#   5. salvage if validation fails               (TODO(A4): force-cleanup worktree+
#                                                 branch + write `failed:<reason>`
#                                                 outcome with recovery hint;
#                                                 stubbed in this A3 commit —
#                                                 currently writes the outcome but
#                                                 leaves the cleanup to the trap)
#   6. write outcome sidecar                     (`merged-content` on happy path;
#                                                 `merged-local` when local diverges
#                                                 from origin; `no-content` on 0
#                                                 commits since startSha; `failed:<reason>`
#                                                 on validation failure)
#   7. cleanup (trap): force-remove worktree, prune, force-delete branch
#
# Error handling:
#   Any fatal failure writes a log entry to:
#     <errorDir>/<ISO-timestamp>-<pid>-<branch-short-hash>.log
#   and proceeds to cleanup. We never `exit` before the trap so worktrees and
#   branches are always torn down.
#
# Environment:
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_NO_RECURSE=1  exported so the nested `pi` won't auto-distill
#   NAPKIN_GIT_RETRY_MAX         forwarded to git_retry (cleanup paths only)
#   NAPKIN_GIT_RETRY_DELAY       forwarded to git_retry (cleanup paths only)
#
# Testing hooks:
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_PI_BIN        path to a stub `pi` binary (integration tests).
#                                The agent-driven design means tests that want
#                                to simulate specific outcomes (clean-distill,
#                                conflict-leave-markers, agent-timeout, …) do
#                                so via a stub pi that produces the right
#                                filesystem effects on each invocation.
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_SKIP_PI=1     skip the agent invocation entirely. Tests
#                                that pre-stage filesystem state directly use
#                                this hook; the wrapper proceeds straight to
#                                outcome write. NOTE: at A2 the wrapper still
#                                writes `merged-content` unconditionally on
#                                this path — A3 wires real validation that
#                                fires on the SKIP_PI path too.
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_HALT_AFTER_META=1
#                                halt right after rewriting meta.json's pid to
#                                the wrapper's pid — lets tests inspect the
#                                updated meta without the cleanup trap
#                                wiping the worktree.
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_HALT_AFTER_SHIM=1
#                                halt right after the per-distill napkin shim
#                                is installed at <worktree>/.napkin/distill/bin/napkin
#                                — lets tests inspect the shim contents and PATH
#                                injection without the cleanup trap wiping it.
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_FORCE_CLEANUP=1
#                                trigger the cleanup trap from a controlled
#                                exit point post-shim-install. Unlike the
#                                HALT_AFTER_* hooks this does NOT clear
#                                the EXIT trap — the cleanup function
#                                fires and tests assert on its post-state
#                                (rm-rf fallback, rmdir parent, etc.).
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_TIMEOUT_KILL_GRACE_SECS=<n>

#                                waits before killing a stuck agent).
#                                Production default is 30s; tests assert
#                                escalation against SIGTERM-ignoring stubs
#                                with a short grace so the assertion

#
# Each helper inspects the vault's post-agent state and returns 0 (pass) or
# 1 (fail). Diagnostics go to the error log on failure so the user can see
# what tripped the validator. Helpers are intentionally side-effect-free
# beyond logging — the salvage path (A4) is the only thing that mutates
# the worktree/branch on validation failure.

# validate_no_markers <vault>

# Searches the vault's working tree for residual git conflict markers
# (`<<<<<<< `, `======= ` exact, `>>>>>>> `) at line start. Returns 0
# (pass) when no markers are found, 1 (fail) when any are present. A
# fail logs the offending file paths so recovery is straightforward.
#
# Why scan post-squash on the vault: the agent merges into its branch
# inside the worktree, then squashes onto the default branch in the
# vault. Markers in the agent's branch get squashed into the vault's
# default branch — they become committed corruption in the vault. The
# vault working tree is the canonical post-condition.
#
# Pattern matches what `napkin-distill-merge` flagged historically (PR #11).
# Restricted to `*.md` because that's the only file class the agent
# touches; scanning the entire vault would false-positive on user
# scripts that legitimately discuss markers.
#
# We use a `git ls-files` enumeration (so .gitignore'd content like
# `.napkin/distill/` is skipped automatically) intersected with `*.md`.

# Salvage at A3 is minimal: write `failed:<reason>` outcome + record
# dangling SHA + exit 1. The cleanup trap still runs (worktree+branch
# best-effort removal). A4 will replace this with the explicit salvage
# helper that force-cleans pre-exit and emits a recovery hint into the
# outcome sidecar.
#
# Reason codes (from the V3 verification report):
#   markers-after-agent-exit   — V1 fail, conflict markers in vault *.md
#   head-not-on-default        — V2 fail, vault HEAD not on default branch
#   agent-exit-nonzero         — pi exited non-zero with no other diagnostic
#   agent-timeout              — timeout(1) killed the agent (rc 124 or 137)

# These four codes match the JS-side dispatch table in
# formatOutcomeNotification (extensions/distill/index.ts).

#   124 = timeout fired and target exited within grace period
#   137 = timeout sent SIGKILL after grace period (128 + 9)
# Other non-zero codes are agent crashes proper.
#
