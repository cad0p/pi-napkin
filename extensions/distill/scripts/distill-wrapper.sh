# distill-wrapper — orchestrates a single auto-distill attempt inside a
# per-distill git worktree.
#
# PR #12 architecture: the distill AGENT owns distill content production
# AND the integration phases (merge, squash, push, cleanup). The wrapper
# is a thin shell:
#   1. Worktree setup is already done by createDistillWorkspace before
#      this script runs (git worktree add, session fork, meta.json).
#   2. Wrapper installs the napkin shim (POST-R6-CACHE), cds to PARENT_CWD
#      for cache parity, then invokes `pi --session ... -p $PROMPT` ONCE
#      under a hard `timeout(1)` budget.
#   3. Agent executes the full agent-driven prompt (extensions/distill/
#      distill-prompt.md): distill content + git merge + git merge --squash
#      + git push + git worktree remove + git branch -D.
#   4. Post-agent-exit, wrapper validates the agent's output (markers
#      absent, HEAD on default, commit count) and salvages on failure.
#   5. Wrapper writes the outcome sidecar and exits.
#
# Implementation history: validation (A3) and salvage (A4) landed in
# commits afed6ae and 0d0a262 respectively. The numbered lifecycle
# below reflects the current shape; see git log for the staged
# rollout.
#
# Usage:
#   distill-wrapper.sh <vault> <worktree> <branch> <sessionFork> <prompt> <errorDir> [<model>] [<defaultBranch>] [<parentCwd>] [<maxDurationSecs>] [<expectedCacheRoot>]
#
# Arguments:
#   <vault>          absolute path to the main vault (NOT the worktree)
#   <worktree>       absolute path to the distill worktree (lives under
#                    `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/napkin-distill/<vault-hash>/<suffix>/`;
#                    see `resolveCacheRoot` in extensions/distill/distill-workspace.ts)
#   <branch>         distill branch name (`distill/<hex>-<epoch>`)
#   <sessionFork>    absolute path to the forked session .jsonl inside the worktree
#   <prompt>         resolved agent-driven distill prompt (steps 1–10 with
#                    placeholders already substituted by `buildDistillPrompt`)
#   <errorDir>       absolute path to `<vault.configPath>/distill/errors/`
#   <model>          optional "<provider>/<id>" to pass to `pi --model`
#   <defaultBranch>  optional name of the vault's mainline branch (e.g. `main`,
#                    `master`). When empty/absent, defaults to `main`. The JS
#                    side resolves this via `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
#                    or a HEAD-ref lookup so the wrapper doesn't hardcode `main`.
#   <parentCwd>      REQUIRED. Absolute path of the parent pi session's cwd.
#                    Pi is spawned at this cwd so the system prompt's
#                    `Current working directory:` line is byte-identical
#                    to the parent's, preserving prompt-cache hits. Vault
#                    writes are still routed to the worktree via the
#                    napkin shim installed at
#                    `<worktree>/.napkin/distill/bin/napkin`. The wrapper
#                    hard-fails if this is empty (R7-PERF-7, R7-CI-6) —
#                    silently falling back to <worktree> would re-
#                    introduce the cache regression POST-R6-CACHE fixed.
#   <maxDurationSecs> hard wall-clock budget for the agent task, in
#                    seconds. Wired into `timeout(1)` so the agent is
#                    SIGTERMed (then SIGKILLed after grace) on overrun.
#                    Required: the wrapper hard-fails at startup if
#                    absent or empty. Derived from
#                    `distill.maxDurationMinutes` config; the JS side's
#                    `getMaxDistillDurationMs` (extensions/distill/index.ts)
#                    is the single source of truth for the production default.
#   <expectedCacheRoot> Absolute path to the resolved XDG cache root
#                    (`<XDG_CACHE_HOME or ~/.cache>/napkin-distill/<vault-hash>`)
#                    that contains <worktree>. Used by safe_rm_worktree
#                    to require any path it `rm -rf`s to be a descendant
#                    of THIS root, not just any path containing a
#                    `/napkin-distill/<x>/<y>/` segment (SEC-2 / CORR-3).
#                    Computed JS-side by `resolveCacheRoot()` in
#                    `extensions/distill/distill-workspace.ts` (the same
#                    function that built <worktree>'s parent dir), so the
#                    two sides stay in sync. Required: the wrapper hard-fails
#                    at startup if absent or empty.
#
# Lifecycle (happy path, PR #12):
#   1. install napkin shim at <worktree>/.napkin/distill/bin/napkin and
#      prepend it to PATH (auto-routes agent napkin calls to the worktree)
#   2. cd <parentCwd>                            (cache parity — keeps pi's
#                                                 system prompt cwd line
#                                                 byte-identical to parent's)
#   3. timeout <maxDurationSecs> pi --session <sessionFork> -p <prompt>
#                                                (single agent task: produces
#                                                 content, runs git merge into
#                                                 distill branch, squashes to
#                                                 main, pushes if origin, cleans
#                                                 up worktree+branch — see
#                                                 extensions/distill/distill-prompt.md)
#   4. validate agent output                     (markers, HEAD on default,
#                                                 commit count; see
#                                                 validate_no_markers /
#                                                 validate_head_on_default /
#                                                 validate_commit_count below)
#   5. salvage if validation fails               (force-cleanup worktree+
#                                                 branch + write
#                                                 `failed:<reason>` outcome
#                                                 with recovery hint; see
#                                                 salvage() below)
#   6. write outcome sidecar                     (`merged-content` on happy path;
#                                                 `merged-local` when local diverges
#                                                 from origin; `no-content` on 0
#                                                 commits since startSha; `failed:<reason>`
#                                                 on validation failure)
#   7. cleanup (trap): force-remove worktree, prune, force-delete branch
#
# Error handling:
#   Any fatal failure writes a log entry to:
#     <errorDir>/<ISO-timestamp>-<pid>-<branch-short-hash>.log
#   and proceeds to cleanup. We never `exit` before the trap so worktrees and
#   branches are always torn down.
#
# Environment:
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_NO_RECURSE=1  exported so the nested `pi` won't auto-distill
#
# Testing hooks:
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_PI_BIN        path to a stub `pi` binary (integration tests).
#                                The agent-driven design means tests that want
#                                to simulate specific outcomes (clean-distill,
#                                conflict-leave-markers, agent-timeout, …) do
#                                so via a stub pi that produces the right
#                                filesystem effects on each invocation.
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_SKIP_PI=1     skip the agent invocation entirely. Tests
#                                that pre-stage filesystem state directly use
#                                this hook; the wrapper proceeds straight to
#                                outcome write. NOTE: at A2 the wrapper still
#                                writes `merged-content` unconditionally on
#                                this path — A3 wires real validation that
#                                fires on the SKIP_PI path too.
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_HALT_AFTER_META=1
#                                halt right after rewriting meta.json's pid to
#                                the wrapper's pid — lets tests inspect the
#                                updated meta without the cleanup trap
#                                wiping the worktree.
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_HALT_AFTER_SHIM=1
#                                halt right after the per-distill napkin shim
#                                is installed at <worktree>/.napkin/distill/bin/napkin
#                                — lets tests inspect the shim contents and PATH
#                                injection without the cleanup trap wiping it.
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_FORCE_CLEANUP=1
#                                trigger the cleanup trap from a controlled
#                                exit point post-shim-install. Unlike the
#                                HALT_AFTER_* hooks this does NOT clear
#                                the EXIT trap — the cleanup function
#                                fires and tests assert on its post-state
#                                (rm-rf fallback, rmdir parent, etc.).
#   NAPKIN_DISTILL_TIMEOUT_KILL_GRACE_SECS=<n>
#                                override TIMEOUT_KILL_GRACE_SECS (the
#                                seconds the SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation
#                                waits before killing a stuck agent).
#                                Production default is 30s; tests assert
#                                escalation against SIGTERM-ignoring stubs
#                                with a short grace so the assertion
#                                completes within the outer test timeout.

# safe_rm_worktree <worktree_path> <expected_cache_root>
#
# Defense-in-depth path-safety guard before `rm -rf <worktree>`. The
# wrapper's primary defense is JS-side construction: `resolveCacheRoot`
# in distill-workspace.ts always builds worktrees under
# `<XDG_CACHE_HOME or ~/.cache>/napkin-distill/<vault-hash>/<branch-suffix>/`,
# and `git worktree remove --force <path>` refuses paths not registered
# as worktrees of the vault. But if either control failed (upstream
# refactor bug, malformed test fixture, future code path that passes
# a different path through), the bare `rm -rf "$worktree"` after
# `worktree remove` would run on whatever path was passed in —
# `rm -rf /etc` if the upstream was that broken (SEC-A-2).
#
# This guard adds the wrapper-side check: the worktree's canonical
# path must be a descendant of `<expected_cache_root>` (SEC-2 / CORR-3).
# A bug elsewhere that constructed a path like
# `/some/random/dir/napkin-distill/foo/bar` cannot bypass this check —
# even though it contains the napkin-distill segment, it isn't under
# the resolved root.
#
# `pwd -P` resolves symlinks (and is portable across BSD/GNU,
# unlike `readlink -f` which is GNU-only).
#
# Returns 0 on successful removal (or already-removed). Returns 1
# when the path didn't pass the safety guard — caller must log and
# proceed, never abort: salvage's contract is best-effort cleanup,
# and the outcome-write path matters more than perfectly cleaning up

# --- Post-agent-exit validation helpers (PR #12 A3) -------------------------
#
# Each helper inspects the vault's post-agent state and returns 0 (pass) or
# 1 (fail). Diagnostics go to the error log on failure so the user can see
# what tripped the validator. Helpers are intentionally side-effect-free
# beyond logging — the salvage path (A4) is the only thing that mutates
# the worktree/branch on validation failure.

# list_marker_files <vault> <output_file>
#
# Scan the vault's tracked `*.md` files and write the relative path of
# every file that contains a complete conflict-marker triple to
# <output_file>, one per line. Empty output file = no conflict-marked
# files in the vault. Idempotent: caller is responsible for
# truncating <output_file> first.
#
# Marker triple definition (CORR-A-1, SEC-A-7): a real merge conflict
# always emits ALL THREE marker types (`<<<<<<< `, `======= `, `>>>>>>> `)
# in the same file. The any-of-three rule false-positives on Setext
# H1 underlines and on documentation prose that quotes one or two
# markers; co-presence eliminates those classes. The acknowledged
# tradeoff (a vault that genuinely documents the full triple inside
# a single file) is documented at validate_no_markers below.
#
# Restricted to `*.md` because that's the only file class the agent
# touches; scanning the entire vault would false-positive on user
# scripts that legitimately discuss markers.
#
# Why a `git ls-files` enumeration: gitignored content (e.g. the
# per-distill `.napkin/distill/` shim dir) is skipped automatically.
# Per-file `grep -q` invocations are O(N) in tracked .md files; the
# prior single-pass `xargs grep` was O(1) but couldn't express the
# per-file all-three-co-present predicate. For vaults with thousands
# of .md files this is slower but still well under wall-clock
# budget. CLEAN-A-15 tracks the optimisation opportunity.
#
# bash 3.2 portability (macOS default): `while read -d ''` with array
# `+=` is supported. Process substitution `< <(...)` is also bash 3.2.
#
# Used by:
#   - The pre-distill snapshot capture (right before the agent runs)
#     to record which files already had markers, so post-distill
#     validation can distinguish agent-induced markers from
#     pre-existing ones (CORR-1).
#   - validate_no_markers (post-distill), which calls this helper
#     against the same vault and diffs the two snapshots.

#
# CORR-1: pre-existing markers (from a prior failed run, user error,
# leftover state from a botched manual merge) used to classify as
# `markers-after-agent-exit` because the wrapper had no
# pre-distill marker snapshot. That misled the user into blaming the
# agent for state it didn't create. Capturing the snapshot at
# wrapper start lets us differentiate.
#
# Marker triple definition (CORR-A-1, SEC-A-7): a real merge conflict
# always emits ALL THREE marker types in the same file. See
# list_marker_files for the per-file predicate.
#
# Acknowledged tradeoff: a vault that genuinely documents a complete
# `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` example INSIDE A SINGLE FILE will
# trip the validator post-distill — but if it ALSO tripped
# pre-distill, this code path classifies it as `pre-existing-markers`
# (rc 2) instead of as agent-induced. Users who hit this can escape
# the markers in their docs (leading space, HTML comments) once and
# subsequent distills see no markers either pre or post.
#
# Why scan post-squash on the vault: the agent merges into its branch
# inside the worktree, then squashes onto the default branch in the
# vault. Markers in the agent's branch get squashed into the vault's
# default branch — they become committed corruption in the vault. The

#
# Determines whether the vault has commits on `<default_branch>` that
# haven't reached `origin/<default_branch>`. Distinguishes legitimate
# fast-forward state (local ahead of remote, remote is ancestor of
# local — the agent didn't push but origin's history is intact) from
# divergent state (remote is NOT an ancestor of local — origin and
# local share no linear ancestry, e.g. because a teammate pushed from
# another clone or, less commonly, someone force-pushed origin).
#
# Per the spec at "Push behavior: never force":
#   "Spec the prohibition in the prompt; the wrapper post-validates by
#    checking that origin/<default> only fast-forwarded (its tip is an
#    ancestor of the new tip after push)."
#
# Equality-check (the pre-fix behavior) couldn't tell those two states
# apart — in either case local != remote post-agent. The prompt's
# prohibition was the only enforcement of the no-force-push invariant
# (a soft control). This helper now adds the wrapper-side hard control
# the spec requires (SEC-A-1).
#
# Return codes:
#   0 — local-only (`merged-local` outcome): origin configured AND
#       (no remote-tracking ref yet OR remote is ancestor of local).
#       Either case is legitimate “distilled but not pushed” state.
#   1 — in sync OR no origin configured: proceed to `merged-content`.
#   2 — divergent histories (`failed:divergent-history` outcome):
#       remote is NOT an ancestor of local. The wrapper surfaces this
#       as a failure because the agent's safe-recovery flow
#       (pull --no-rebase + push) did not run or did not converge,
#       and the user must inspect/resolve before the next distill.
#       The naming is neutral on cause: a benign third-party push
#       from another clone is the common case, force-push the rare

#   124 = timeout fired and target exited within grace period
#   137 = timeout sent SIGKILL after grace period (128 + 9)
# Other non-zero codes are agent crashes proper.
#
# Magic-number rationale (per the methodology guide's never-deferrable
