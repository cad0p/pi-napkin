 *
 * Unlike `diffWorktreeSinceStart`, this runs against the MAIN vault —
 * the distill worktree has been removed by the time we're called. The
 * squash commit on main brings every file the distill affected into
 * `<startSha>..HEAD`'s name range.
 *
 * If `startSha` is missing (legacy distill meta) we cannot reliably
 * compute the post-squash file set without scanning the now-removed
 * worktree, so we return `[]`. Overlap detection is best-effort.
 *
 * Paths are returned relative to the vault root (matching
 * `getSessionTouchedFiles` output for the intersection step).
 *
 * Downstream `intersectFiles` matches paths in three layers — exact /
 * symmetric-suffix / basename-fallback. The basename-fallback's known
 * false-positive shape (two unrelated `README.md`s in different
 * subtrees match) flows through here too; accepted because the overlap
 * notice is non-destructive (advisory message, doesn't modify files).
 * Concurrent-distill log noise is a separate accepted false-positive
 * class (when two pi sessions on the same vault complete in close
 * succession, the second's `<startSha>..HEAD` includes the first's
 * squash commit). See `deferred.md` R8-CC-5.
