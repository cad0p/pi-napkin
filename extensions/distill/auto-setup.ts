/**
 * First-run auto-setup for auto-distill.
 *
 * Auto-distill needs the vault to be a git repo with a `.gitignore` that
 * excludes its ephemeral state (distill worktrees, Obsidian workspace-local
 * caches). Vaults typically ship without any of this — we scaffold it at
 * `session_start` when `distill.enabled` is true.
 *
 * PR #12 (agent-driven merge): pre-PR-12 auto-distill also installed an
 * `*.md merge=napkin-distill-merge` rule in `.gitattributes` to route
 * concurrent-distill conflicts through an LLM merge driver. PR #12 deleted
 * that driver — the distill agent now resolves merges itself in its
 * worktree, so the rule is no longer needed. New vaults never get the rule
 * installed. Existing vaults that already have it are left alone (manual
 * cleanup; the rule becomes inert once the driver script is gone — git
 * silently falls back to its built-in merge driver). See design.md
 * "Migration" for rationale.
 *
 * Design contract:
 *   - Idempotent: re-running on an already-set-up vault is a no-op (returns
 *     `{ initialized: false, scaffolded: [] }`).
 *   - Non-destructive: never clobbers existing `.gitignore` content; only
 *     appends missing lines.
 *   - Fail-soft: returns `{ error }` instead of throwing so the caller can
 *     surface a notify() and keep the session alive.
